# Book-Search
Book search program for CIS 227
Changes:Updated the entire project to be more object-oriented, more classes and such.



TODO:
1. Does not do any integrity checks for shopper’s email, name, total spent when creating a shopper’s account. This could potentially cause issues.
2. There is a slight delay in the view shopping list and select the add book to list. Then once it does finally load, it brings up the main menu after flashing text that doesn’t belong there.
3. There is no way to clear the books from the shopping list right now, and checking out with the books does not clear the list either.
